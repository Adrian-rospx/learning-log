#### March

- Finished the C [**CLI calculator**](https://github.com/Adrian-rospx/calc-cli.git) 
learning project - Mar-30
- Implemented queues and stacks manually, along with postfix conversion for 
the calculator project. Much debugging to be done - Mar-26
- Used ***Pygame*** to make a **Merge Sort and Quick Sort** algorithm animation - Mar-24
- ***Linked list*** and ***dynamic array*** implementations in C - Mar-18
- Made the algorithm visualisations for **insertion sort** and **selection sort**  
using **Python Turtle** - Mar-16
- [Python](https://github.com/Adrian-rospx/Python.git) repository. - Mar-10
    - Found this website for organization: [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)
- ANSI codes for coloring terminal output and basic formatting - Mar-06
- [Algorithms & Data Structures](https://github.com/Adrian-rospx/Algorithms-Data-Structures.git)
repository. - Mar-03
    - learned about time and space complexity & Big O notation
- completed an ASCII graphics ***clock animation*** - Mar-02

#### 1st of March
- learned a great deal about keyboard shortcuts and efficiency
- managed to finally use CMake, meaning I can soon begin using third-party libraries

#### 24th of February
- Began learning CSS
- Learned to configure vscode themes and now I love the look of the editor

#### 23rd of February

- Made a circle drawing algorithm program in C++
- Tried to install several Linux distros, but the only one that actually worked was Mint.

I am curious about bash commands because a lot of the tools I use, such
as GCC and Git are Linux based and I have run into problems when trying
to use cmake for example. I'll try WSL.

#### line drawing algorithm graphics project - Feb-21

#### 20th of February

- URLs and DNS
- basics of how Web Browsers work

I think this concludes my deepdive into the computer infrastructure we use 
everyday. I now have a bit of an overview of how operating systems and the
internet works. I have to move on to practical projects.

Started the **WebDev** repo and learned about **HTML** following
[this tutorial](https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?si=40-EgLgE5XYCWGhq).

#### 19th of February

Basics of Networking:

- OSI model's 7 layers
- TCP/IP model
- IP addresses
- TCP protocol
- what sockets are
- HTTP

I do realise I am only looking superficially at this information, but
I am more intersted in only getting the grasp of these domains.
Now, for example, I at least have an idea of what's going on when data
is transferred and how browsers interact with users, but the complexity
is still amazing. I  now know that running a server or, say, making a 
chat app is doable.

#### 18th of February
Learned about **Make files** and how to use them along with **headers**
in C projects

I learned about the roles of the Operating System:
- Process management (processes and threads)
- Memory management (virtual memory, paging)
- File systems (file formats, directories)
- I/O and device drivers
- Networking
- Security
- providing APIs and systemcalls
- offering GUIs and CLIs

#### 17th of February
I learned about hardware:
- how the **keyboard and mouse** work in general
- how the **Motherboard** connects to components on a computer
- the process of starting the operating system after powering on the computer
- the **UART** communication protocol and a bit about how USB works

To say the least, I am much more amazed at the ingenuity behind
everyday systems we use and I realised the complexity behind
communication protocols within devices

#### 16th of February
- I found out how markdown **.md** files work and made the first README files

Finished with assembly after looking at:
- arithmetic and logic instructions
- jump instructions

#### 15th of February
Started learning a bit about assembly:
- memory registers
- found out how to convert .c into .s files
- what the stack is

#### 8th of February
I learned about the what instruction sets are

I Discovered touch typing and began learning it

#### 7th of February 
I started looking at the **architecture of Computers** from the ground up:
- Adders and ALUs from logic gates
- Latches and memory registers
- (S)RAM and mutliplexers
- a simple 8-bit CPU
- the fetch-decode-execute stages

I followed the online series [Crash Course Computer Science](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&si=fPEFP-QnYMBBTocU)

#### 4th of February

I started being interested in understanding computers and the internet

Began learning the C programming language (having some prior knowledge of C++ from
school).
