# Learning-log
This repository is to document my learning journey
when it comes to software, computers and programming.  
Created on the 18th of February

[C, C++](https://github.com/Adrian-isp/Low-Level-Concepts.git)  
[Web Development](https://github.com/Adrian-isp/WebDev.git)  
[Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/Adrian-isp/Algorithms-Data-Structures.git)  
[Python](https://github.com/Adrian-isp/Python.git)

---

#### 10th of March
- Started the [Python](https://github.com/Adrian-isp/Python.git) repository.
- I found this website useful for organization: [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)

#### 6th of March:
- ANSI codes for coloring terminal output and basic formatting

#### 5th of March:
Used these roadmaps for orientation:

- [C++ Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/cpp)
- [Neetcode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)

#### 3rd of March:
- started the 
[Algorithms & Data Structures](https://github.com/Adrian-isp/Algorithms-Data-Structures.git)
repository.
- learned about time and space complexity & Big O notation

#### 2nd of March: completed an ASCII graphics clock animation

#### 1st of March
- fixed the line drawing algorithm
- learned a great deal about keyboard shortcuts and efficiency
- managed to finally use CMake, meaning I can soon begin using third-party libraries

#### 24th of February
- Began learning CSS
- Learned to configure vscode themes and now I love the look of the editor

#### 23rd of February

- Made a circle drawing algorithm program in C++
- Tried to install several Linux distros, but the only one that actually worked was Mint.

I am curious about bash commands because a lot of the tools I use, such
as GCC and Git are Linux based and I have run into problems when trying
to use cmake for example. I'll try WSL.

#### 21st of February: Made an ASCII graphics project
- Bresenham's line drawing algorithm in C++

#### 20th of February

- URLs and DNS
- basics of how Web Browsers work

I think this concludes my deepdive into the computer infrastructure we use 
everyday. I now have a bit of an overview of how operating systems and the
internet works. I have to move on to practical projects.

Started the **WebDev** repo and learned about **HTML** following
[this tutorial](https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?si=40-EgLgE5XYCWGhq).

#### 19th of February

Basics of Networking:

- OSI model's 7 layers
- TCP/IP model
- IP addresses
- TCP protocol
- what sockets are
- HTTP

I do realise I am only looking superficially at this information, but
I am more intersted in only getting the grasp of these domains.
Now, for example, I at least have an idea of what's going on when data
is transferred and how browsers interact with users, but the complexity
is still amazing. I  now know that running a server or, say, making a 
chat app is doable.

#### 18th of February
Learned about **Make files** and how to use them along with **headers**
in C projects

I learned about the roles of the Operating System:
- Process management (processes and threads)
- Memory management (virtual memory, paging)
- File systems (file formats, directories)
- I/O and device drivers
- Networking
- Security
- providing APIs and systemcalls
- offering GUIs and CLIs

#### 17th of February
I learned about hardware:
- how the **keyboard and mouse** work in general
- how the **Motherboard** connects to components on a computer
- the process of starting the operating system after powering on the computer
- the **UART** communication protocol and a bit about how USB works

To say the least, I am much more amazed at the ingenuity behind
everyday systems we use and I realised the complexity behind
communication protocols within devices

#### 16th of February
- I found out how markdown **.md** files work and made the first README files

Finished with assembly after looking at:
- arithmetic and logic instructions
- jump instructions

#### 15th of February
Started learning a bit about assembly:
- memory registers
- found out how to convert .c into .s files
- what the stack is

#### 8th of February
I learned about the what instruction sets are

I Discovered touch typing and began learning it

#### 7th of February 
I started looking at the **architecture of Computers** from the ground up:
- Adders and ALUs from logic gates
- Latches and memory registers
- (S)RAM and mutliplexers
- a simple 8-bit CPU
- the fetch-decode-execute stages

I followed the online series [Crash Course Computer Science](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&si=fPEFP-QnYMBBTocU)

#### 4th of February

I started being interested in understanding computers and the internet

Began learning the C programming language (having some prior knowledge of C++ from
school).
