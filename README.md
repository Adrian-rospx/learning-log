### 1st of March

- learned a great deal about keyboard shortcuts and efficiency
- managed to finally use CMake, meaning I can soon begin using third-party libraries

### 24th of February

- Began learning CSS
- Learned to configure vscode themes and now I love the look of the editor

### 23rd of February

- Made a circle drawing algorithm program in C++
- Tried to install several Linux distros, but the only one that actually worked was Mint.

I am curious about bash commands because a lot of the tools I use, such
as GCC and Git are Linux based and I have run into problems when trying
to use cmake for example. I'll try WSL.

### line drawing algorithm graphics project - Feb-21

### 20th of February

- URLs and DNS
- basics of how Web Browsers work

I think this concludes my deepdive into the computer infrastructure we use
everyday. I now have a bit of an overview of how operating systems and the
internet works. I have to move on to practical projects.

Started the **WebDev** repo and learned about **HTML** following
[this tutorial](https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?si=40-EgLgE5XYCWGhq).

### 19th of February

Basics of Networking:

- OSI model's 7 layers
- TCP/IP model
- IP addresses
- TCP protocol
- what sockets are
- HTTP

I do realise I am only looking superficially at this information, but
I am more intersted in only getting the grasp of these domains.
Now, for example, I at least have an idea of what's going on when data
is transferred and how browsers interact with users, but the complexity
is still amazing. I  now know that running a server or, say, making a
chat app is doable.

### 18th of February

Learned about **Make files** and how to use them along with **headers**
in C projects

I learned about the roles of the Operating System:

- Process management (processes and threads)
- Memory management (virtual memory, paging)
- File systems (file formats, directories)
- I/O and device drivers
- Networking
- Security
- providing APIs and systemcalls
- offering GUIs and CLIs

### 17th of February

I learned about hardware:

- how the **keyboard and mouse** work in general
- how the **Motherboard** connects to components on a computer
- the process of starting the operating system after powering on the computer
- the **UART** communication protocol and a bit about how USB works

To say the least, I am much more amazed at the ingenuity behind
everyday systems we use and I realised the complexity behind
communication protocols within devices

### 16th of February

- I found out how markdown **.md** files work and made the first README files

Finished with assembly after looking at:

- arithmetic and logic instructions
- jump instructions

### 15th of February

Started learning a bit about assembly:

- memory registers
- found out how to convert .c into .s files
- what the stack is

### 8th of February

I learned about the what instruction sets are

I Discovered touch typing and began learning it

### 7th of February

I started looking at the **architecture of Computers** from the ground up:

- Adders and ALUs from logic gates
- Latches and memory registers
- (S)RAM and mutliplexers
- a simple 8-bit CPU
- the fetch-decode-execute stages

I followed the online series [Crash Course Computer Science](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&si=fPEFP-QnYMBBTocU)

### 4th of February

I started being interested in understanding computers and the internet

Began learning the C programming language (having some prior knowledge of C++ from
school).
